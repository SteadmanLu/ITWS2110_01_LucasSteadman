ChatGPT Prompts with Comments to explain them
    Prompt --> I need you to make me a website that uses OpenWeatherMap, and another API of your choosing. Ive included
                the API key for OpenWeatherMap, as const weatherApiKey at the top of the Js file. Now go!
    Comment --> I didn't want to give it my API key, in fear that it would then give it to other people. 

    Prompt --> Add geolocation support, and a 5 day forcast
    Comment --> It gave some sugestions so I chose a few to try and get it to implement them

    Prompt --> First off Auto Location doesn't work
    Comment --> I was going to give it a few things to work on but hit enter before typing them all out

    Prompt --> yes add New York as a defult city, also add the state and or contry to the display so that 
                people can make sure they have the right place. Also add a second API that actual works you 
                CLANKER
    Comment --> It gave a few sugestions on how to fix the problem, the one that seemed most secure in working was
                    a defult city. I also noticed that in the location selector it provided I could enter places but had noticed
                    way of making sure it was the right place, so I had it edit that. ChatGPT also never used a second API, so I
                    wanted it to fix that

    Prompt --> can you make a C vs F selector?
    Comment --> I thought this would be nice

    Prompt --> can you give me a list of API's that could be included in this website?
    Comment --> This was my best idea to get ChatGPT to actually use a second API, but having it 
                    generate a list for me before telling it to implement the one I thought to be 
                    the most fun

    Prompt --> can you implemet TheCocktailDB API that you found?
    Comment -->  I thought this was the most fun API it found

    Prompt --> since this is for school is there a way to have the dinks be Non Alcoholic?
    Comment --> I thought this was prudent becuase it was recomending only alcoholic drinks
