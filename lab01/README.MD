ITWS 2110 Project Group Reposititory
Lab - 01 - Group Page and resumes

Main page:
    The initial template for the main page was taken from a previous project, and updated with the current needs for the lab. Basic styling was done to keep 
    resumes proffesional, and maintain consistency between pages. The main information section was filled in with a mix of fake and real projects. The footer 
    holds the main team picture and resumes, with the order in the picture matching the order of links.


Henry resume page:
    I pulled my previous resume project (lab 2 from Intro to ITWS) to use as a base. I then reformatted and partially restyled the page to make it more professional overall. Informative tags and comments were also added throughout to make the markup itself more readable. Once major changes were done, I added information to descriptions for work and school experience, as well as added a skills section at the bottom.

Lucas resume page -->
    I did the same as Henry and used my resume from Intro ITWS as a base. I had to take the format that I used for the Intro class and make it mesh properly with our group homepage. I also had to update my resume to be accurit which was mainly just the experience and education sections. Adding on the Microformats was a little strange but wasn't that difficult, just required a little bit of W3schools. I think honsetly the hardest part of this was dusting off old cobwebs, making sure I was using GitHub properaly and all.
