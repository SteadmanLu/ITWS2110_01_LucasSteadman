Restaurant Menu Website - Quiz 1

Key Choices
    Layout Decision
        The quiz instructions said to display the data "at least in a table," but since there were 4 required dishes, 
            I thought it made the most sense to display the data in a grid pattern. I thought it fit the amount of 
            data well along with showing off the images better. All images are license-free, obtained from pixabay.com. 
            The design is also responsive so that the boxes stack on mobile devices.

    Dish Selection
        The dishes I chose are all from my recipe book. I thought they worked well because they represent a few different 
        cuisines and dietary options. It also made choosing a theme for my fictitious restaurant easier because they are all 
        dishes I have fairly regularly, so naming it "Easy Eats" made sense and was a quick way to include alliteration.

Technical Implementation
    Used semantic HTML (especially as there is a quiz question on it)
    Used XMLHttpRequest to load the JSON data dynamically
    Kept the JavaScript simple using template literals
    In the CSS, I used gradients, shadows, and hover effects
    Had the color palette revolve around green because I thought it fits the theme well
    Color-coded the dietary options so they stand out for the user
